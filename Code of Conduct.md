# Code of Conduct

## Philosophy

I am a believer in Negative Obligation.

Negative Obligation: The "negative" aspect means the state has a duty not to censor, silence, or punish individuals for their expressions.

The following project aims for fast blunt development, and due so it allows freedom expression, open debate, and frequent critique. Strong opinions, blunt feedback, and intense technical discussion are permitted and encouraged. Watching out for people's opinions and dancing around feelings is where ideas die.

The objective is to improve the project, not a HR environment.

Participants will be expected to collaborate, even when disagreements are direct or confrontational.

## Freedom of Expression

Contributors are free to:

- Express strong technical criticism
- Disagree openly and directly
- Challenge design decisions
- Use harsh language regarding code quality
- Engage in clearly labeled satire or trolling

Due to fear of being offensive and controversial, Speech will not be moderated harshly.
