# License Justification

## License
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

## Overview
This project is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, published by 2007 Free Software Foundation. This is a strong copyleft license designed to protect software freedom following negative ethics to ensure that work can be used for study and encourage new user interaction.

## Choice Reason

The primary goal of this project to establish a permantly open repository where people help contribute to a game(preferably MMORPG) framework. GNU was selected because it 
- Freedom to use the software for any purpose, including commercial use
- Access to source code
- The right to modify and redistribute the software
- A requirement that derivative works also remain licensed under GPL v3

## Project Philosophy

The project aims to:

- Encourage Collboration
- Serve as Examples for future game developers
- Maintain long-term openness
- Promote transparent software distribution

## Future Considerations

In future development phases, non-code assets (such as artwork, music, and lore) may be licensed under a Creative Commons license (e.g., CC BY-SA 4.0) to properly distinguish between software licensing and creative content licensing.

This separation will maintain legal clarity while preserving the project's commitment to open collaboration.
