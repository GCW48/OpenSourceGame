# License Justification

## License
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

## Overview
This project is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, published by 2007 Free Software Foundation. This is a strong copyleft license designed to protect software freedom following negative ethics to ensure that work can be used for study and encourage new user interaction.

## Choice Reason

The primary goal of this project to establish a permanently open repository where people help contribute to a game (preferably MMORPG) framework. GNU was selected because it 
- Freedom to use the software for any purpose
- Access to source code
- The right to modification and redistribution
- Derivative works also remain licensed

## Project Philosophy

The project aims to:

- Encourage Collboration
- Serve as Examples for future game developers
- Maintain openness
- Promote software distribution

## Future Considerations

In future development phases, non code assets (such as artwork, music, and lore) may be licensed under a Creative Commons license (e.g., CC BY-SA 4.0) to properly distinguish between software licensing and creative content licensing.
